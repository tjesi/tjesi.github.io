I think it is important to contribute to the community by organizing seminars and conferences so that members can meet and discuss joint interestes, and be on program committies to promote and support the progress of scientific research.

## Organization

I was on the organizing committee for [Eurocrypt 2022](https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2022) in Trondheim. Colin Boyd was the General Chair.

I organized the [Norwegian Crypto Seminar 2020](https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/nks/nks20) together with Kristian Gj√∏steen and Martin Strand, and organized the [Norwegian Crypto Seminar 2021](https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/nks/nks21) together with Lise Millerjord and Martin Strand.

I previously organized the NTNU Post-Quantum Cryptography Reading Group together with Anamaria Costache.
