I believe it is important to contribute to the community by organizing seminars and conferences for members to meet and discuss joint interests, and be on program committees to promote and support the progress of open scientific research.

## Organization

I am organising the [International Workshop on Foundations and Applications of Privacy-Enhancing Cryptography](https://privcryptworkshop.github.io) as an affilated event at [IACR Eurocrypt 2026](https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2026) in Rome on May 10., 2026, together with [Lucjan Hanzlik](https://lucjanhanzlik.github.io) and [Daniel Slamanig](https://danielslamanig.info).

I was the general chair for [IACR PKC 2025](https://pkc.iacr.org/2025) in [Røros](https://www.visitnorway.com/places-to-go/trondelag/roros) together with [Bor de Kock](https://bordekock.nl) which was organised May 12.-15., 2025.

I organized the workshop on "[Foundations and Applications of Zero-Knowledge Proofs](https://www.icms.org.uk/ZeroKnowledgeProofs)" together with [Elizabeth Crites](https://elizabeth-crites.github.io), [Markulf Kohlweiss](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mkohlwei), and [Akira Takahashi](https://akiratk0355.github.io) at the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences in Edinburgh in 2024.

I was on the organizing committee for [IACR Eurocrypt 2022](https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2022) in Trondheim. [Colin Boyd](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CIfBKmMAAAAJ&hl) was the General Chair.

I organized [Norwegian Crypto Seminar 2020](https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/nks/nks20) with Kristian Gjøsteen and Martin Strand, [Norwegian Crypto Seminar 2021](https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/nks/nks21) with Lise Millerjord and Martin Strand, and [Norwegian Crypto Seminar 2024](https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/nks/nks24) with Slobodan Petrovic.

I previously organized the NTNU Post-Quantum Cryptography Reading Group together with [Anamaria Costache](https://anamariacostache.github.io/anamariacostache).

## External Assignments

I have testified as an expert witness on the encryption used and the data collection performed via a Man-in-the-Middle attack
conducted by Europol against the E2EE service SKY ECC at 1) [Borgarting Court of Appeal](https://lovdata.no/dokument/LBSTR/avgjorelse/lb-2024-142625) in Oslo in April 2025, 2) Oslo District Court in Oslo in May 2025, and 3) [Gulating Court of Appeal](https://lovdata.no/dokument/LGSTR/avgjorelse/lg-2025-43360) in Bergen in June 2025.
