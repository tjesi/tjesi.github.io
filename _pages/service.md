I believe it is important to contribute to the community by organizing seminars and conferences for members to meet and discuss joint interests, and be on program committees to promote and support the progress of scientific research.

## Organization

I will be the general co-chair for IACR PKC 2025 in [Røros](https://www.visitnorway.com/places-to-go/trondelag/roros) together with [Bor de Kock](https://bordekock.nl) to be organised May 12.-15., 2025.

I am organising a workshop on "[Foundations and Applications of Zero-Knowledge Proofs](https://www.icms.org.uk/ZeroKnowledgeProofs)" together with [Elizabeth Crites](https://elizabeth-crites.github.io/), [Markulf Kohlweiss](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mkohlwei), and [Akira Takahashi](https://akiratk0355.github.io/) at the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences in Edinburgh from September 2nd to 6th, 2024.

I was on the organizing committee for [Eurocrypt 2022](https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2022) in Trondheim. Colin Boyd was the General Chair.

I organized the [Norwegian Crypto Seminar 2020](https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/nks/nks20) together with Kristian Gjøsteen and Martin Strand, and organized the [Norwegian Crypto Seminar 2021](https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/nks/nks21) together with Lise Millerjord and Martin Strand.

I previously organized the NTNU Post-Quantum Cryptography Reading Group together with Anamaria Costache.
