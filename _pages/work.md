## Internships or Research Visits

I am happy to host intership students interested in my area of research, but I do not have funding for this myself.  
You need to apply for scholarships, for example [Erasmus+](https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu) or [Fulbright](https://us.fulbrightonline.org), and then we can offer affordable housing.  
Please also see the NTNU page about [placement students](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/placement) before sending me an email.

## Master's Thesis

I am happy to supservise master's students in the [Mathematical Sciences](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/msmnfma), [Cyber Security and Data Communication](https://www.ntnu.no/studier/mtkom), [Digital Infrastructure and Cyber Security](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/mstcnns), or [Security and Cloud Computing](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/mssecclo) programs at NTNU. Please get in touch if you follow one of these programs, have top grades from at least two of the courses [TTM4135 - Applied Cryptography and Network Security](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TTM4135), [TTM4137 - Wireless Network Security](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TTM4137), [TMA4160 - Cryptography](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TMA4160), [TMA4162 - Computational Algebra](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TMA4162), [TTM4195 - Blockchain Technologies and Cryptocurrencies](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TTM4195), or [TTM4205 - Secure Cryptographic Implementations](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TTM4205), and are interested in my field of research.


## PhD or Postdoc Positions

All of my open positions will be announced on [my homepage](https://tjerandsilde.no) and at [iacr.org/jobs](https://iacr.org/jobs). All applications needs to go through the application portal on [jobbnorge.no](https://www.jobbnorge.no/search/en) to be evaluated. I expect all applicants to have a strong background in cryptography, and preferably also a solid background in either information security, algebra and number theory, algorithms and programming, theoretical computer science, or electrical engineering.
