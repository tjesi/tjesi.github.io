## Internship

I am happy to host interships, but I do not have funding for this myself. You need to apply for scholarships, for example [Erasmus+](https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu). Please also see the NTNU page about [placement students](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/placement) before sending me an email.

## Master's thesis

I am happy to supservise master's students in the [Cyber Security and Data Communication](https://www.ntnu.no/studier/mtkom), [Digital Infrastructure and Cyber Security](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/mstcnns), or [Security and Cloud Computing](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/mssecclo) programs at NTNU. Please get in touch if you follow one of these programs and are interested in my research.


## PhD or Postdoc positions

All of my open positions will be announced at [my homepage](https://tjerandsilde.no) and on [iacr.org/jobs](https://iacr.org/jobs). All applications needs to go through the application portal on [jobbnorge.no](https://www.jobbnorge.no/search/en) to be evaluated.
