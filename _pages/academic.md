## Conferences
I organized the [Norwegian Crypto Seminar 2020](https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/nks/nks20) together with Kristian Gj√∏steen and Martin Strand.

I'm on the organizing committee for [Eurocrypt 2022](https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2022) in Trondheim. Colin Boyd is the General Chair.

 I have been a reviewer at [CT-RSA 2020](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-40186-3) (for Jiaxin Pan) and [SAC 2020](https://sac2020.ca) (for Diego Aranha).

## Research Groups
I'm a member of the [Algebra Group](https://www.ntnu.edu/imf/research/algebra) at the Department of Mathematics and the [NTNU Applied Cryptology Lab](https://www.ntnu.edu/iik/nacl-lab) at the Department of Information Security and Communication Technology.

I'm also a member of the [COINS Research School of Computer and Information Security](https://coinsrs.no) for Ph.D. students in Norway.

## Research Visits
I'm grateful to [Carsten Baum](http://www.carstenbaum.com) and the [Aarhus Crypto Group](https://cs.au.dk/research/cryptography-and-security) for hosting me for one week in November 2019.
