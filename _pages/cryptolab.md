I received 765K NOK from the scientific equipment fund at [IE Faculty - Research](https://www.ntnu.edu/ie/research) to build a cryptology lab for theoretical and practical cryptographic research and education. The CRYPTO-LAB is located at [Electro A176](https://link.mazemap.com/nYuDTF8q).

The CRYPTO-LAB is currently used by students in the course [TTM4205 Secure Cryptographic Implementations](http://ttm4205.iik.ntnu.no) at NTNU to conduct side-channel experiments using [ChipWhisperer Husky](https://rtfm.newae.com/Capture/ChipWhisperer-Husky) and [ChipWhisperer Level 1 Starter Kit](https://rtfm.newae.com/Starter%20Kits/SCAPACK-L1) equipment.
