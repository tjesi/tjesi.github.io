Hi! I am an Associate Professor in cryptology at the [Department of Information Security and Communication Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/iik) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, where I am a member of the [NTNU Applied Cryptology Lab](https://www.ntnu.edu/iik/nacl-lab). I am also a Security and Cryptography Expert at [Pone Biometrics](https://ponebiometrics.com/the-team).

My main foci of research are lattice-based cryptography and zero-knowledge protocols. My interests also span the areas of secure multiparty computation, homomorphic encryption, password-authenticated key exchange, electronic voting and anonymous communication.

I am a member of the [International Association for Cryptologic Research](https://iacr.org) (IACR).

**News**:

- We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher in ["Lightweight Post-Quantum Cryptography"](https://www.jobbnorge.no/en/available-jobs/job/243244/postdoctoral-fellow-in-lightweight-post-quantum-cryptography). The application deadline is May 1st, 2023.
- I am on the program committee for [E-Vote-ID 2023](https://e-vote-id.org) (deadline May 15th) and [PETS 2024](https://www.petsymposium.org) (First deadline May 31st). Submit your best voting and privacy papers!
- Our paper [Verifiable Mix-Nets and Distributed Decryption for Voting from Lattice-Based Assumptions](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/422.pdf) is accepted at ACM CCS 2023. This is joint work with Diego F. Aranha, Carsten Baum and Kristian Gj√∏steen.
- I started as an Associate Professor in cryptology at the Department of Information Security and Communication Technology at NTNU on September 1st, 2022.
- Our project "[OffPAD -- Optimizing balance between high security and usability](https://prosjektbanken.forskningsradet.no/en/project/FORISS/321619)" got funded 16M NOK by the Norwegian Research Council for research on lightweight and PQ crypto.

I support the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/join-eff-4), the [Tor Project](https://donate.torproject.org) and the [Signal Foundation](https://signal.org/donate).
