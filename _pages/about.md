My name is Tjerand. I’m a PhD student in cryptography at the Department of Mathematics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim.

My main focus of research are lattice based cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs. I’m also interested in elliptic curve cryptography, secure multi-party computation and e-voting.

Check out my [employee page at NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/tjerand.silde) or my research at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=fWLrd9MAAAAJ&hl=en). I’m also a university college teacher at [Western Norway University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hvl.no/en), an editor at [Sikkerhet Online](https://www.sikkerhet.online/author/tjerand-silde) and lead developer at [Lær Kidsa Koding](http://oppgaver.kidsakoder.no).
