Hi! I am an Associate Professor in cryptology at the [Department of Information Security and Communication Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/iik) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, where I am a member of the [NTNU Applied Cryptology Lab](https://www.ntnu.edu/iik/nacl-lab). I am also a Security and Cryptography Expert at [Pone Biometrics](https://ponebiometrics.com/the-team).

My main foci of research are lattice-based cryptography and zero-knowledge protocols. My interests also span the areas of secure multiparty computation, homomorphic encryption, password-authenticated key exchange, electronic voting and anonymous communication.

I graduated from NTNU with a B.Sc. in 2017, a M.Sc. in 2020 and a Ph.D. in Mathematics in 2022, respectively. During my master's, I spent the academic year 2017-2018 at UC Berkeley, USA. During my PhD, I spent the fall of 2020 visiting [Assistant Professor Carsten Baum](http://carstenbaum.com) and [Associate Professor Diego Aranha](https://dfaranha.github.io) at the [Aarhus Crypto Group](https://users-cs.au.dk/orlandi/cryptogroup), Denmark, and I spent the winter 2021/2022 visiting [Professor Jonathan Katz](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz) at the [Maryland Cybersecurity Center](https://cyber.umd.edu), USA.

I have previously been working as a project manager at [Lær Kidsa Koding](https://www.kidsakoder.no) (2015-17), as a university college teacher at [Western Norway University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hvl.no/en) (2017-20), and I had a 3 months internship in 2018 at the IoT-security company [Intrinsic-ID](https://www.intrinsic-id.com) in Eindhoven, NL.

I am a member of the [International Association for Cryptologic Research](https://iacr.org) (IACR).

**News**:
