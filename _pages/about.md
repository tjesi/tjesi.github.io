Hi! I am an Associate Professor in Cryptology at the [Department of Information Security and Communication Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/iik) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, where I am the Research Group Leader of the [NTNU Applied Cryptology Lab](https://www.ntnu.edu/iik/nacl-lab).

I am also a Security and Cryptography Expert at the cybersecurity company [Pone Biometrics](https://ponebiometrics.com/the-team).

My main foci of research are lattice-based cryptography and zero-knowledge protocols. My interests also span the areas of post-quantum cryptography, anonymous communication, multiparty computation, homomorphic encryption, electronic voting and secure implementation.

I am a member of the [International Association for Cryptologic Research](https://iacr.org) (IACR).

**News**:

- I am organising a workshop on "[Foundations and Applications of Zero-Knowledge Proofs](https://www.icms.org.uk/ZeroKnowledgeProofs)" together with Elizabeth Crites, Markulf Kohlweiss, and Akira Takahashi at the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences in Edinburg from September 2nd to 6th, 2024.
- I published an opinion piece in Morgenbladet about end-to-end encryption and surveillance with respect to the new EU proposal Chat Control 2.0 (in Norwegian): [EU-kommisjonens forsvar for Chat Control 2.0 bygger på enten løgn eller inkompetanse](https://www.morgenbladet.no/ideer/kronikk/2023/09/05/eu-kommisjonens-forsvar-for-chat-control-20-bygger-pa-enten-logn-eller-inkompetanse).
- We are looking for a [PhD Student in Cryptographic Engineering](https://www.jobbnorge.no/en/available-jobs/job/246480/phd-candidate-in-cryptography-engineering) and a [Postdoctoral Fellow in Lightweight Post-Quantum Cryptography](https://www.jobbnorge.no/en/available-jobs/job/248833/postdoctoral-fellow-in-lightweight-post-quantum-cryptography). Application deadline is September 15th.
- I am teaching the new course [TTM4205 Secure Cryptographic Implementations](https://tjerandsilde.no/TTM4205) this fall. 
- Our paper [Verifiable Mix-Nets and Distributed Decryption for Voting from Lattice-Based Assumptions](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/422.pdf) is accepted at ACM CCS 2023. This is joint work with Diego F. Aranha, Carsten Baum and Kristian Gjøsteen.
- I started as an Associate Professor in Cryptology at the Department of Information Security and Communication Technology at NTNU on September 1st, 2022.
- Our project "[OffPAD -- Optimizing balance between high security and usability](https://prosjektbanken.forskningsradet.no/en/project/FORISS/321619)" got funded 16M NOK by the Norwegian Research Council for research on lightweight and PQ crypto.

I support the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/join-eff-4), the [Tor Project](https://donate.torproject.org) and the [Signal Foundation](https://signal.org/donate).
