My name is Tjerand. I’m a second year PhD student in cryptography at the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.ntnu.edu/imf) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim. My supervisors are [Professor Kristian Gjøsteen](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/kristian.gjosteen) and [Professor Colin Boyd](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/colin.boyd). I am\
also working as a cryptography consultant at [Pone Biometrics](https://ponebiometrics.com).

My main foci of research are lattice-based cryptography and zero-knowledge protocols. My interests also span the areas of secure multiparty computation, password-authenticated key exchange, electronic voting and anonymous credentials.

I graduated from NTNU with a B.Sc. in Mathematics in 2017 and a M.Sc. in Mathematics in 2020, respectively. I spent the academic year 2017-2018 at UC Berkeley, California, USA, and\
I spent the fall of 2020 visiting the [Aarhus Crypto Group](https://users-cs.au.dk/orlandi/cryptogroup) at Aarhus University, Denmark.

I've previously been working as a project manager at [Lær Kidsa Koding](https://www.kidsakoder.no) (2015-17), as a university college teacher at [Western Norway University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hvl.no/en) (2017-20), and I had a 3 months internship in 2018 at the IoT-security company [Intrinsic-ID](https://www.intrinsic-id.com) in Eindhoven, NL.
