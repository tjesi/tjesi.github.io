Hi! I am an Associate Professor in Cryptology at the [Department of Information Security and Communication Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/iik) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, where I am the research group leader of the [NTNU Applied Cryptology Lab](https://www.ntnu.edu/iik/nacl-lab).

I am also a Security and Cryptography Expert at the cybersecurity company [Pone Biometrics](https://ponebiometrics.com/the-team).

My main foci of research are lattice-based cryptography and zero-knowledge protocols. My interests also span the areas of post-quantum cryptography, secure multiparty computation, homomorphic encryption, electronic voting and anonymous communication.

I am a member of the [International Association for Cryptologic Research](https://iacr.org) (IACR).

**News**:

- New paper "[Concrete NTRU Security and Advances in Practical Lattice-Based Electronic Voting](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/933)" is available on ePrint. Joint work with Patrick Hough and Caroline Sandsbråten.
- We are looking for a PhD student in Cryptographic Engineering with application deadline September 15, [see the announcement at jobbnorge.no here](https://www.jobbnorge.no/en/available-jobs/job/246480/phd-candidate-in-cryptography-engineering).
- I am on the program committee for [E-Vote-ID 2023](https://e-vote-id.org/call-for-papers-2023) (deadline May 15th), [Latincrypt 2023](https://www.espe.edu.ec/latincrypt) (deadline May 26th), [PETS 2024](https://www.petsymposium.org/cfp24.php) (first deadline May 31st, 2023) and [WAHC 2023](https://homomorphicencryption.org/workshops-wahc23) (deadline July 7th). Submit your best voting / crypto / privacy / FHE papers!
- Our paper [Verifiable Mix-Nets and Distributed Decryption for Voting from Lattice-Based Assumptions](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/422.pdf) is accepted at ACM CCS 2023. This is joint work with Diego F. Aranha, Carsten Baum and Kristian Gjøsteen.
- I started as an Associate Professor in Cryptology at the Department of Information Security and Communication Technology at NTNU on September 1st, 2022.
- Our project "[OffPAD -- Optimizing balance between high security and usability](https://prosjektbanken.forskningsradet.no/en/project/FORISS/321619)" got funded 16M NOK by the Norwegian Research Council for research on lightweight and PQ crypto.

I support the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/join-eff-4), the [Tor Project](https://donate.torproject.org) and the [Signal Foundation](https://signal.org/donate).
