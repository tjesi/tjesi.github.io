My name is Tjerand. I’m a first year PhD student in cryptography at the Department of Mathematics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim.  
My supervisor is Professor Kristian Gjøsteen.

My main foci of research are lattice-based cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs. My interests also span the areas of secure multi-party computation, password-authenticated  
key-exchange and electronic voting.

I graduated from NTNU with a B.Sc. in Mathematics in 2017<!---and a M.Sc. in Mathematics in 2020, respectively--->. I spent the academic year 2017-2018 at UC Berkeley, California, USA.

I've previously been working as a project manager at [Lær Kidsa Koding](https://www.kidsakoder.no) (2015-16), as a university college teacher at [Western Norway University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hvl.no/en) (2017-20), and I had a 3 months internship in 2018 at the IoT-security company [Intrinsic-ID](https://www.intrinsic-id.com) in Eindhoven, NL.

**News:** I will be visiting [Carsten Baum](http://www.carstenbaum.com), [Ivan Damgård](https://users-cs.au.dk/~ivan) and the [Aarhus Crypto Group](https://cs.au.dk/research/cryptography-and-security) fall 2020.
