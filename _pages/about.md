My name is Tjerand. I’m a PhD student in cryptography at the Department of Mathematics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim.

My main foci of research are lattice-based cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs. My interests also span the areas of secure multi-party computation, password-authenticated key-exchange and electronic voting.

 I also serve as a university college teacher at [Western Norway University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hvl.no/en), an editor at [Sikkerhet Online](https://www.sikkerhet.online/author/tjerand-silde) and lead developer at [Lær Kidsa Koding](http://oppgaver.kidsakoder.no).

 I will be visiting [Ivan Damgård](https://users-cs.au.dk/~ivan/) and the [Aarhus Crypto Group](https://cs.au.dk/research/cryptography-and-security) the fall semester 2020.
