My name is Tjerand. I’m a second year PhD student in cryptography at the Department of Mathematics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim. \ My supervisor is Professor Kristian Gjøsteen.

My main foci of research are lattice-based cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs. My interests also span the areas of secure multi-party computation, password-authenticated key-exchange and electronic voting.

I graduated from NTNU with a B.Sc. in mathematics in 2017 and a M.Sc. in mathematics in 2020, respectively. I spent the academic year 2017-2018 at UC Berkeley.

I've previously been working as a project manager at [Lær Kidsa Koding](https://www.kidsakoder.no) (2015-16), as a university college teacher at [Western Norway University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hvl.no/en) (2017-20), and I've had a 3 months internship in 2018 at the IoT-security company [Intrinsic-ID](https://www.intrinsic-id.com) in Eindhoven, The Netherlands.

In my spare time, I serve as a community manager at [Kodeklubben](http://oppgaver.kidsakoder.no) (2015-) and as an editor at [Sikkerhet Online](https://www.sikkerhet.online) (2018-).

**News:** I will be visiting [Carsten Baum](http://www.carstenbaum.com), [Ivan Damgård](https://users-cs.au.dk/~ivan) and the [Aarhus Crypto Group](https://cs.au.dk/research/cryptography-and-security) fall 2020.
