Hi! I am an Associate Professor in Cryptology at the [Department of Information Security and Communication Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/iik) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)  
in Trondheim, where I am the Research Group Leader of the [NTNU Applied Cryptology Lab](https://www.ntnu.edu/iik/nacl-lab).

I am also a Security and Cryptography Expert at the cybersecurity company [Pone Biometrics](https://ponebiometrics.com).

My main foci of research are lattice-based cryptography and zero-knowledge protocols. My interests generally span the areas of post-quantum crypto, anonymous communication, multiparty computation, homomorphic encryption, electronic voting and secure implementation.


I am a member of the [International Association for Cryptologic Research](https://iacr.org) (IACR).

**News**:

- I will be on sabbatical leave from January 15th to July 15th during spring 2025.
- We opened the [CRYPTO-LAB](cryptolab) for theoretical and practical cryptographic research and education in September 2024.
- [Two-Round Threshold Lattice-Based Signatures from Threshold Homomorphic Encryption](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1318) is published at [PQCrypto 2024](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/events/conferences/pqcrypto-2024)! Joint work with Kamil Doruk Gur and Jonathan Katz.
- I will be the general co-chair for [IACR PKC 2025](https://pkc.iacr.org/2025) in [RÃ¸ros](https://www.visitnorway.com/places-to-go/trondelag/roros) together with [Bor de Kock](https://bordekock.nl)!
- I started as an Associate Professor in Cryptology at the Department of Information Security and Communication Technology at NTNU on September 1st, 2022.

I support the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/join-eff-4), the [Tor Project](https://donate.torproject.org) and the [Signal Foundation](https://signal.org/donate).
