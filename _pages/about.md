My name is Tjerand. I am a third year PhD student in cryptography at the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.ntnu.edu/imf) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, where I am a member of the [NTNU Applied Cryptology Lab](https://www.ntnu.edu/iik/nacl-lab). My supervisor is [Professor Kristian Gjøsteen](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/kristian.gjosteen). I am
also working as a cryptography advisor at [Pone Biometrics](https://ponebiometrics.com).

Note: I am currently visiting [Professor Jonathan Katz](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz) at the University of Maryland, USA.

My main foci of research are lattice-based cryptography and zero-knowledge protocols. My interests also span the areas of secure multiparty computation, homomorphic encryption, password-authenticated key exchange, electronic voting and anonymous communication.

I graduated from NTNU with a B.Sc. in Mathematics in 2017 and a M.Sc. in Mathematics in 2020, respectively. I spent the academic year 2017-2018 at UC Berkeley, California, USA, and\
I spent the fall of 2020 visiting the [Aarhus Crypto Group](https://users-cs.au.dk/orlandi/cryptogroup) at Aarhus University, Denmark.

I have previously been working as a project manager at [Lær Kidsa Koding](https://www.kidsakoder.no) (2015-17), as a university college teacher at [Western Norway University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hvl.no/en) (2017-20), and I had a 3 months internship in 2018 at the IoT-security company [Intrinsic-ID](https://www.intrinsic-id.com) in Eindhoven, NL.

I am a member of the [International Association for Cryptologic Research](https://iacr.org) (IACR).
