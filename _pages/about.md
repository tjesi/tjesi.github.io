Hi! I am an Associate Professor in Cryptology at the [Department of Information Security and Communication Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/iik) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)  
in Trondheim, where I am the Research Group Leader of the [NTNU Applied Cryptology Lab](https://www.ntnu.edu/iik/nacl-lab).

I am leading the Post-Quantum Crypto workpackage in the [OFFPAD project](https://prosjektbanken.forskningsradet.no/en/project/FORISS/321619), the [Cryptology and Social Life project](https://www.ntnu.edu/iik/cryptology-and-social-life), and the [ToppForsk@IE:Cryptography group](https://www.ntnu.edu/web/iik/toppforsk-ie-cryptography). 

I am also a Security and Cryptography Expert at the cybersecurity company [Pone Biometrics](https://ponebiometrics.com).

My main foci of research are lattice-based cryptography and zero-knowledge protocols. My interests generally span the areas of post-quantum cryptography, anonymous communication, multiparty computation, homomorphic encryption, electronic voting and secure implementation.


I am a member of the [International Association for Cryptologic Research](https://iacr.org) (IACR).

**News**:

- I gave a talk on "[Challenges and Opportunities from Quantum-Safe Cryptography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph8yoeN6ZwE)" [PDF](https://tjerandsilde.no/files/PQC.pdf)”
 at the [NDC Security](https://ndc-security.com/speakers/tjerand-silde) conference in Oslo on January 23rd, 2025.
- I will be on sabbatical leave from January 15th to July 15th during spring 2025.
