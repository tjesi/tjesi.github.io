Hi! I am an Associate Professor in Cryptology at the [Department of Information Security and Communication Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/iik) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)  
in Trondheim, where I am the Research Group Leader of the [NTNU Applied Cryptology Lab](https://www.ntnu.edu/iik/nacl-lab).

I am leading the Post-Quantum Cryptography work package in the [OFFPAD project](https://prosjektbanken.forskningsradet.no/en/project/FORISS/321619), the [Cryptology and Social Life project](https://www.ntnu.edu/iik/cryptology-and-social-life), and the [ToppForsk@IE:Cryptography research group](https://www.ntnu.edu/web/iik/toppforsk-ie-cryptography).  
I am coordinating the "Cryptographic Engineering" profile in the [Cyber Security and Data Communication](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/mtkom) master of science in engineering program at NTNU.

I am also a Security and Cryptography Expert at the cybersecurity company [Pone Biometrics](https://ponebiometrics.com).

My main foci of research are lattice-based cryptography and zero-knowledge protocols. My interests generally span the areas of post-quantum cryptography, anonymous communication, multiparty computation, homomorphic encryption, electronic voting and secure implementation.


I am a member of the [International Association for Cryptologic Research](https://iacr.org) (IACR).

**News**:

- Kristian Gjøsteen (NTNU), Jonathan Komada Eriksen (KU Leuven), Øyvind Ytrehus and Morten Øygarden (both UiB), and I published an opinion piece in digi.no today about [PQC vs. QKD](https://www.digi.no/artikler/debatt-spekulativ-kvanteteknologi-loser-ikke-sikkerhetsproblemene-vare/568500), arguing that post‑quantum cryptography is the right path forward.
- Join the [International Workshop on Foundations and Applications of Privacy-Enhancing Cryptography](https://privcryptworkshop.github.io) as an affilated event at [IACR Eurocrypt 2026](https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2026) in Rome on May 10th! I am co-organising this workshop together with [Lucjan Hanzlik](https://lucjanhanzlik.github.io) and [Daniel Slamanig](https://danielslamanig.info).
- Together with more than 800 scientists, we published [an open letter](https://csa-scientist-open-letter.org/Sep2025) in September to address the EU Presidency’s new proposal for the Child Sexual Abuse / Chat Control Regulation. We [published another letter](https://csa-scientist-open-letter.org/Nov2025) in November to address recent changes.
- [More Efficient Lattice-Based Verifiable Decryption from LWR](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3733811.3767315) is accepted to [WAHC @ ACM CCS 2025](https://homomorphicencryption.org/wahc-2025)! Joint work with Thomas Haines, Emil August Hovd Olaisen, and Peter Rønne.
- I gave a talk on "[Cryptographic Side-Channels on Embedded Devices](https://tjerandsilde.no/files/TechTown.pdf)" at the [NDC TechTown](https://ndctechtown.com/speakers/tjerand-silde) conference in Kongsberg on September 25th, 2025.
- We recently opened the [CRYPTO-LAB](cryptolab) for theoretical and practical cryptographic research and education, currently used in [TTM4205 Secure Cryptographic Implementations](http://ttm4205.iik.ntnu.no).
- I started as an Associate Professor in Cryptology at the Department of Information Security and Communication Technology at NTNU on September 1st, 2022.

I support the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/join-eff-4), the [Tor Project](https://donate.torproject.org) and the [Signal Foundation](https://signal.org/donate).
