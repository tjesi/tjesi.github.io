## Projects

I am Co-Principal Investigator of the project "[OffPAD -- Optimizing balance between high security and usability](https://prosjektbanken.forskningsradet.no/en/project/FORISS/321619)" funded by the Research Council Norwegian with 16M NOK for research on lightweight and post-quantum secure cryptography. This is a joint project with among others [Danilo Gligoroski](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/danilo.gligoroski) at NTNU and the cybersecurity company [Pone Biometrics](https://ponebiometrics.com).

I received 765K NOK from the scientific equipment fund at [IE Faculty - Research](https://www.ntnu.edu/ie/research) to build a cryptology lab for theoretical and practical cryptographic research and education. The [CRYPTO-LAB](cryptolab) is located at [Electro A176](https://link.mazemap.com/nYuDTF8q).

I am leading [ToppForsk@IE:Cryptography](https://www.ntnu.edu/web/iik/toppforsk-ie-cryptography), focusing on quantum safe and privacy-preserving cryptography, funded 200K NOK by the [NTNU IE Faculty](https://www.ntnu.edu/ie). This is a collaboration with [Anamaria Costache](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/anamaria.costache), [Kristian Gjøsteen](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/kristian.gjosteen), and [Jeongeun Park](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/jeongeun.park).

I am leading the "[Cryptology and Social Life](https://www.ntnu.edu/iik/cryptology-and-social-life)" project, funded 200K NOK from [NTNU Community](https://www.ntnu.edu/community). This is a collaboration with [Katrien De Moor](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/katrien.demoor), [Emil André Røyrvik](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/emil.royrvik), and [Petter Grytten Almklov](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/petter.almklov).
