## Conferences
I organised [Norwegian Crypto Seminar 2020](https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/nks/nks20) at Kjeller together with Kristian Gjøsteen and Martin Strand.

I'm on the organising committee for [Eurocrypt 2020](https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2021) in Trondheim.

 I have been a subreviewer for [CT-RSA 20](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-40186-3).

## Supervisors
My main supervisor is [Professor Kristian Gjøsteen](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/kristian.gjosteen) at the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.ntnu.edu/imf).

My co-supervisor is [Professor Colin Boyd](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/colin.boyd) at the [Department of Information Security and Communication Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/iik).

## Research Visits
I'm grateful to [Carsten Baum](http://www.carstenbaum.com) and the [Aarhus Crypto Group](https://cs.au.dk/research/cryptography-and-security) for hosting me for one week in November 2019.

## Research Groups
I'm a part of the [Algebra Group](https://www.ntnu.edu/imf/research/algebra) at the Department of Mathematics and the [NTNU Applied Cryptology Lab](https://www.ntnu.edu/iik/nacl-lab) at the Department of Information Security and Communication Technology.

I'm also a member of the [COINS Research School of Computer and Information Security](https://coinsrs.no) for PhD. students in Norway.
