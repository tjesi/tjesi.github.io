I believe that all scientific publications should be freely available online, given that researchers and peer-reviewers are largely supported by public funding. Therefore I am committed to make all my papers availabe to the general public. If there is a paper of mine you would like to read but do not have access to, please write me an email and I will be happy to share a copy with you.

## Projects

I am Co-Principal Investigator of the project "[OffPAD -- Optimizing balance between high security and usability](https://prosjektbanken.forskningsradet.no/en/project/FORISS/321619)" funded by the Research Council Norwegian with 16M NOK for research on lightweight and post-quantum secure cryptography. This is a joint project with among others [Danilo Gligoroski](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/danilo.gligoroski) at NTNU and the cybersecurity company [Pone Biometrics](https://ponebiometrics.com).

I received 765K NOK from the scientific equipment fund at [IE Faculty - Research](https://www.ntnu.edu/ie/research) to build a cryptology lab for theoretical and practical cryptographic research and education. The [CRYPTO-LAB](cryptolab) is located at [Electro A176](https://link.mazemap.com/nYuDTF8q).

We received seed funding of 200K NOK from [NTNU Community](https://www.ntnu.edu/community) to the project "Cryptography and social life", joint work with [Katrien De Moor](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/katrien.demoor), [Emil André Røyrvik](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/emil.royrvik), and [Petter Grytten Almklov](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/petter.almklov).
