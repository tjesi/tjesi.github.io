## Publications

I believe that all scientific publications should be freely available online, given that researchers and peer-reviewers are largely supported by public funding. Therefore I am committed to make all my papers availabe to the general public. If there is a paper of mine you would like to read but do not have access to, please write me an email and I will be happy to share a copy with you.
