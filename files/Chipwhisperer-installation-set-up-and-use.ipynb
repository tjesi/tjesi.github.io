    "I would higly recommend to use a virtual machine when using Chipwhisperer. When using a VM there isn't a lot to install other than the machine and the image to run, you may need to update the firmware as you go, but there is a notebook for this in the machine. Here is a step by step to install VirtualBox and the chipwhisperer image. \n",

    "- Install the VirtualBox Extension pack, which can be found on the VirtualBox downloads page linked above. This is necessary for the VM to interact with the ChipWhisperer hardware. Note that the license for the Extension pack differs from the base VirtualBox license: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox_PUEL\n",
    "- Download a ChipWhisperer virtual machine image release or build it yourself using Vagrant. VM images come as .7z files and can be found on the GitHub releases page, typically being called ChipWhisperer.Jupyter.7z or similar. Find the latest release from this link https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer/releases\n",

    "- Log in (user: vagrant pass: vagrant).\n",
    "- Setup a new password for Jupyter. As of release 5.2.0, you will be prompted to set a password on startup if one doesn’t exist for Jupyter. For older releases, simply type jupyter notebook password in the command prompt, then set a password. Note that Jupyter will not start until this is done. This password will be needed to log into Jupyter, so make sure you record it as well.\n",
    "- Reboot the VM.\n",
    "- Once the VM is booted, you can connect to Jupyter via localhost:8888 ( Firefox/Chrome ONLY). You will be asked for the password you set via jupyter notebook password\n",
    "\n",
    "You shouldn’t need to log in to the VM again to run Jupyter (which provides the interface) as it should start automatically, but make sure you still record the password you set for the vagrant account, as you will need to log in to update ChipWhisperer.\n",
